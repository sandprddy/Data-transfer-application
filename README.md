# Data-transfer-application
  A distributed networking application in Java consisting of a transmitter and a receiver that can ensure reliable data transfer and cryptographic authentication. The application uses Java’s UDP sockets (classes DatagramPacket and DatagramSocket and their methods) and provides the necessary reliable data transfer functionality on the top of UDP’s unreliable communication services by implementing the data transfer protocol described below. The data transfer is one-directional with data flowing from the transmitter to the receiver.
